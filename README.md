# Vaseh Version 0.0.00

Vaseh (pronounced 'vase') is a collection of my commonly made plotting and visualization functions, organized for my convenience. After all, where else do you put a bokeh but in a vaseh?

The focus of these plots is not scientific publishing, but quick and easy data exploration. It makes exploring scatter plots easeir, leveraging the benifits of bokeh without constantly needing to drag and drop the same large block of code in every notebook.

And if you're not interested in this plotting wrapper at large, you can simply open up the code and copy and paste what you need where you need it!
